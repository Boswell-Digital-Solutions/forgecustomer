## 5. Data Model

Supabase/PostgreSQL is the authoritative store for customer and commercial state. The
schema is additive and deterministic under `supabase/migrations`.

### Migration domains

| Migration | Domain | Primary tables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0001_customer_identity.sql` | Customer identity projection | `customer_profiles`, `customer_status_history`, `customer_emails` |
| `0002_product_catalog.sql` | Product catalog | `products`, `product_versions`, `features`, `plans`, `plan_versions`, `plan_features`, `plan_quotas`, `release_channels` |
| `0003_commerce.sql` | Commerce and Stripe projection | `billing_accounts`, `stripe_customers`, `subscriptions`, `subscription_items`, `billing_periods`, `checkout_sessions`, `invoice_references`, `stripe_webhook_events` |
| `0004_licensing.sql` | Licenses, installations, devices | `licenses`, `license_grants`, `devices`, `installations`, `license_activations`, `license_leases`, `license_revocations` |
| `0005_entitlements.sql` | Entitlements | `entitlement_grants`, `entitlement_overrides`, `entitlement_snapshots` |
| `0006_usage.sql` | Usage and quotas | `usage_meters`, `usage_reservations`, `usage_events`, `usage_period_totals`, `quota_decisions` |
| `0007_audit_outbox.sql` | Audit and outbox | `commercial_audit_events`, `outbox_events` |
| `0008_privacy.sql` | Privacy and deletion | `policy_versions`, `consent_records`, `account_deletion_requests` |
| `0009_rls.sql` | Row-level security | Enables and forces RLS; creates own-row and public-catalog policies. |
| `0010_seed_constraints.sql` | Determinism and indexes | Adds seed/constraint hardening and operational indexes. |
| `0011_fleet_release_update_domain.sql` | Fleet, release, and update campaigns | `fleets`, `fleet_applications`, installation update metadata, `product_releases`, `release_artifacts`, `update_campaigns`, `update_campaign_holds`, `installation_update_events` |

### RLS posture

RLS is enabled and forced across public tables. Customer-facing records are scoped by the
business `customer_id`, not only by the Supabase auth subject. Catalog tables are public
read. Published release metadata/artifacts have public read policies; fleet/application
and update-event records are scoped to the owning customer. CI asserts that all public
tables have RLS enabled.

The API still owns privileged writes. RLS is defense in depth, not a substitute for the
server-side authorization model.

### Append-only state

Append-only tables are part of the commercial trust boundary:

- `usage_events`
- `commercial_audit_events`
- `installation_update_events`
- webhook/event receipt tables where replay protection matters
- outbox delivery records, except operational status fields required for retry/dead-letter

Corrections must be represented by new compensating events, never by silently editing the
authoritative ledger.

### Catalog seed model

Products, plan versions, features, quotas, and release channels are seeded
deterministically. Adding a future product should be data-first: insert product/catalog
rows and only add schema when a genuinely new domain concept exists.

### Repository layer

The Rust API uses SQLx runtime query APIs. The crate does not require a live database for
compile-time query macro verification. Repository functions currently cover customer
profile lookup and catalog list operations; additional DB-backed endpoints should add
repository functions rather than embedding ad hoc SQL in route handlers.
