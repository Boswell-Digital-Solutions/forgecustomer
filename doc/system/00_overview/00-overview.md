## 1. Overview

ForgeCustomer is the customer, commerce, licensing, entitlement, installation, device,
fleet/update, usage, privacy, and commercial-audit authority for Boswell Digital
Solutions products.
The first product is AuthorForge, but the catalog and entitlement model are product
generic.

ForgeCustomer is implemented as a Rust/Axum API backed by a dedicated Supabase
PostgreSQL project. Supabase Auth supplies login identity. ForgeCustomer keeps its own
business `customer_id` and owns customer/commercial truth. Stripe owns payment
processing. DataForge receives sanitized downstream evidence and is not a source of
truth.

### Current readiness

The repository is an MVP foundation, not a complete production commerce surface.

Implemented today:

- Rust workspace with `forgecustomer-api`.
- Environment-driven configuration with fail-closed token verification.
- Axum router, liveness/readiness/version endpoints, correlation IDs, security headers,
  and router-level request guards (per-client rate limiting, body cap, timeout).
- API-owned account provisioning that maps a Supabase auth subject to one ForgeCustomer
  business customer profile idempotently.
- Stripe Checkout Session creation for active paid catalog plans.
- Stripe webhook signature verification, minimal non-PII event parsing, idempotent
  processing, subscription projection, invoice reference recording, commercial audit, and
  sanitized `subscription_changed` outbox emission.
- Subscription-linked license issuance and sync (issue/suspend/expire/reactivate, device
  limit from plan features) inside webhook processing.
- Installation registration (idempotent by install key, optional Ed25519 device
  identity), server-resolved default fleet assignment, update metadata capture, license
  activation with device-limit and revocation enforcement, heartbeat, deactivation, and
  read-own installation/device/license listings, with audit and sanitized
  `installation_registered` / `license_activated` outbox emission.
- Entitlement snapshot assembly from included-plan baseline, subscription plan, license
  grants, promotional grants, and admin overrides — evaluated fail-closed, Ed25519
  signed, stored for audit/replay, and returned with wire field order matching the
  canonical signing order.
- Advisory feature/quota checks and signed offline-lease issuance (`forge.lease.v1`)
  for activated installations, denied for suspended/revoked contexts.
- The Forge Command admin surface: customer lookup, suspend/restore, Stripe subscription
  resync, operator license issue/revoke, entitlement overrides, compensating usage
  adjustments, fleet policy, release validation/publication/block, update-campaign
  controls, fleet holds, update failure reads, artifact quarantine, and audit reads —
  mutations role-gated (`admin`), reason-required, and audited with the operator as actor.
- AuthorForge update foundation: fleet/release/artifact/campaign/hold/outcome schema,
  deterministic HMAC rollout, dynamic Tauri-compatible update lookup, and bounded
  update-event receipts that reject raw diagnostics.
- The usage lifecycle: advisory checks, idempotent lock-serialized reservations with
  expiry (lazy + background sweeper), reservation/direct commits on the append-only
  ledger with explainable quota decisions, releases, and per-meter current totals;
  threshold and commit-failure outbox events.
- The account-deletion workflow: customer request/cancel, operator
  advance/reject/execute with a non-destructive cooling-off, a one-transaction
  anonymization (profile PII, emails, devices, licenses, installations) with a PII-free
  receipt and the sanitized `customer_anonymized` outbox event; anonymized accounts fail
  closed at the auth boundary. The customer subscription summary endpoint.
- Public product and plan catalog endpoints backed by SQLx repositories.
- Customer and admin JWT extraction boundaries.
- Public entitlement key endpoint and Ed25519 signing/key-ring services.
- Pure domain logic for subscription normalization, entitlement precedence, usage
  decisions, device limits, offline lease validation, redaction, Stripe webhook signature
  verification, and DataForge publish hygiene.
- Supabase migrations for identity, catalog, commerce, licensing, entitlements, usage,
  audit/outbox, privacy, RLS, seed constraints, and fleet/release/update domains.
- CI for Rust formatting, clippy, tests, migration determinism, RLS coverage,
  customer RLS write-denial, release package publication smoke, update-campaign HTTP
  smoke, OpenAPI linting, schema parsing, secret scan, and dependency audit.

Every customer, webhook, and admin route is implemented; no handler returns
`NOT_IMPLEMENTED`. Still pending before AuthorForge can rely on the service end to end:

- CI-runnable DB-backed end-to-end suites (the live local verification suites covering
  licensing, entitlements, usage, admin, and deletion are the blueprint).

### Primary doctrine

- Customer clients never receive Supabase service-role keys, Stripe secrets, admin
  secrets, or entitlement signing private keys.
- All privileged commercial mutations go through the ForgeCustomer API.
- Browser redirects never activate entitlements. Verified Stripe webhooks do.
- Usage and commercial audit data are append-only. Corrections are compensating events.
- DataForge outage must not block customer transactions; the outbox queues sanitized
  evidence for retry.
- ForgeCustomer never stores manuscripts, prompts, creative project content, diagnostics,
  Sentinel records, repair findings, or general ecosystem knowledge.
